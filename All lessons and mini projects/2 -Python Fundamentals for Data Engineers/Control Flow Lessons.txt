Control Flow:

Lesson 1:
Boolean Expressions
example_statement = "No"

statement_one = "Yes"

statement_two = "Yes"

statement_three = "No"

statement_four = "Yes"

Lesson 2:
Relational Operators: Equals and Not Equals
statement_one = True

statement_two = False

statement_three = True

Lesson 3:
Boolean Variables
my_baby_bool = "true"
print(type(my_baby_bool))
my_baby_bool_two = True
print(type(my_baby_bool_two))

Lesson 4:
If Statement
# Enter a user name here, make sure to make it a string
user_name = 'angela_catlady_87'

if user_name == "Dave":
  print("Get off my computer Dave!")
if user_name == "angela_catlady_87":
  print("I know it is you, Dave! Go away!")

Lesson 5
Relational Operators II
x = 20
y = 20

# Write the first if statement here:
if x == y:
  print("These numbers are the same")


credits = 120

# Write the second if statement here:
if credits >= 120:
  print("You have enough credits to graduate!")

Lesson 6
CONTROL FLOW
Boolean Operators: and

statement_one = (2 + 2 + 2 >= 6) and (-1 * -1 < 0)

credits = 120
gpa = 3.4

if credits >= 120 and gpa >=2.0:
  print("You meet the requirements to graduate!")

Lesson 7
Boolean Operators: or
statement_one = (2 - 1 > 3) or (-5 * 2 == -10)

statement_two = (9 + 5 <= 15) or (7 != 4 + 3)

credits = 118

Boolean Operators: not
statement_one = not (4 + 5 <= 9)

Else Statements

credits = 120

Else If Statements
